### Hello everyone, I'm Rohan 👋

<!--
**rohan-jagtap04/rohan-jagtap04** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. !-->

I'm a full stack developer with three prior paid development internships. I'm a third year @ the University of Waterloo studying Software Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence! 👨‍🎓

In my previous roles, I have set up the backend for an internal tool using Java, MongoDB, and GraphQL at RBC. Created Knowledge Graphs with Python and PowerBI and optimized Cloud Deployments with Microsoft Azure, Databricks, and SQL at KPMG. I have also worked on chatbots which use OpenAI's LLM services to deliver specialized knowledge about Nuclear Facilities at Nuclear Promise X (NPX). 🧑‍💻

I am looking for deeper Knowledge Graph experiences with Big Data and Website Performance Optimization! 🤖

Actively looking for internship/co-op/research opportunities! 🎓
